Recursion
a. What	is	Recursion?
In	previous	lectures,	we	used	iteration	to	solve	problems.	Now,	weâ€™ll	learn	about	
recursion	 for	 solving	 problems	which	 contain	 smaller	 sub-problems	 of	 the	 same	
kind.	
Recursion	 in	 computer	 science	 is	 a	 method	 where	 the	 solution	 to	 a	 problem	
depends	on	solutions	to	smaller	instances	of	the	same	problem.	By	same	nature	it	
actually	means	that	the	approach	that	we	use	to	solve	the	original	problem	can	be	
used	to	solve	smaller	problems	as	well.	
So	 in	 other	 words	 in	 recursion	 a	 function	 calls	 itself	 to	 solve	 smaller	 problems.
Recursion	is	a	popular	approach	for	solving	problems	because	recursive	solutions	
are	generally	easier	to	think	than	their	iterative	counterparts	and	the	code	is	also	
shorter	and	easier	to	understand.
